## Overview

This repository contains the full reproducible pipeline associated with the preprint  
**“Testing a Siamese Interference Dark Sector with Triple Cosmological Falsification.”**

The project presents the first complete theoretical study of *Siamese Interference Cosmology*, an alternative to ΛCDM in which Dark Energy emerges as an interference effect between two CPT-symmetric branches of the Universe.

The model is implemented through a PNGB scalar field and evaluated using **strict Popperian falsification**:  
no late-time parameters are fitted to observational data.

## Cosmological Tests Included

| Test | Observable | Outcome |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Expansion History** | \(H(z)\) vs BAO + Cosmic Chronometers | The tested realisation **over-accelerates** the Universe |
| **Effective Equation of State** | \(w_{\mathrm{eff}}(z)\) | \(w_{\mathrm{eff}}(0) \approx -0.7\), in tension with \(w \approx -1\) |
| **Siamese Interference Entropy** | \(S_{\mathrm{local}}\) and \(dS_{\mathrm{local}}/dN\) | **Open prediction** for future tests (FRBs, QSOs, CMB EB/TB) |

The purpose of this work is not to defend the model but to evaluate transparently whether its predictions succeed or fail.
